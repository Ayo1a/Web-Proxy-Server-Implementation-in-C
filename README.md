 * A Simple Web Proxy Server Implementation in C                                *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *
 * This code demonstrates the basic implementation of a simple web proxy server *
 * using C programming language. The server accepts a single command-line       *
 * argument: the URL to retrieve. It then attempts to fetch the requested       *
 * resource either from the local cache (file system) or directly from the web  *
 * if the resource is not available locally.                                    *
 *                                                                              *
 * The program showcases skills in network programming, including working with  *
 * sockets, HTTP protocol handling, and basic file operations in C. It includes *
 * functions for parsing URLs, connecting to servers, sending HTTP requests,    *
 * and handling server responses. It also demonstrates creating directories     *
 * for storing cached files, thus mimicking basic caching behavior of a proxy.  *
 *                                                                              *
